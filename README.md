# GhostBudget

GhostBudget is a Node.js application that synchronizes account balances between [Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) and [Ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio). It automatically fetches your account balances from Actual Budget and updates the corresponding accounts in Ghostfolio. Big thanks to authors and contributors from both projects! 

## Features

- Automatic authentication with both Actual Budget and Ghostfolio
- Configurable account mapping between the two systems
- Automatic balance conversion from Actual Budget's format to Ghostfolio's format
- Detailed logging for monitoring and troubleshooting
- Error handling with helpful messages

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- An Actual Budget server instance
- A Ghostfolio instance
- Access tokens/credentials for both services

The script will:
1. Fetch account balances from Actual Budget
2. Authenticate with Ghostfolio
3. Get the current account list from Ghostfolio
4. Map accounts between the two systems
5. Update balances in Ghostfolio

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnkrzywanek/ghostbudget.git
cd ghostbudget
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create configuration files:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp config.json.example config.json
```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials and settings
5. Edit the `config.json` file with your account mappings

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

- `ACTUAL_BUDGET_URL`: URL of your Actual Budget server
- `ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASS`: Your Actual Budget server password
- `ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID`: Your budget's sync ID
- `ACTUAL_BUDGET_DATA_DIR`: Directory for Actual Budget data. Must be an absolute
  path to an existing, writable directory; the container sets this to the
  `/actual-budget` volume mount.
- `GHOSTFOLIO_URL`: URL of your Ghostfolio instance
- `GHOSTFOLIO_TOKEN`: Your Ghostfolio access token
- `CRON_TASK`: Schedule for the container's built-in scheduler (Docker only).
  A five-field cron expression such as `0 5 * * *`, or one of `@hourly`,
  `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@yearly`, `@annually`.
  Six- and seven-field expressions are rejected: an extra leading field is read
  as seconds, so `0 5 * * * *` would run hourly rather than daily.

### Account Mapping (config.json)

The `config.json` file maps accounts between Actual Budget and Ghostfolio. Example structure:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "ghostfolioName": "Exact name of account in Ghostfolio",
      "actualBudgetName": "Exact name of account in Actual Budget"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Account names must match exactly with the names in both systems.

## Usage

### Running the Sync

You can run the synchronization with different log levels:

```bash
# Normal operation (info level logs)
npm run sync

# With debug information
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm run sync

# Only show errors
LOG_LEVEL=error npm run sync
```

### Log Levels

- `error`: Only logs errors
- `warn`: Logs errors and warnings
- `info`: Normal operational messages (default)
- `debug`: Detailed debugging information

### Log Files

Logs are written to:
- `logs/combined.log`: Contains all logs
- `logs/error.log`: Contains only error logs
- Console: Shows colored output for development

## Automated Execution

### Using Docker (recommended)

The container has its own scheduler — there is no `cron` inside the image and no
host crontab to maintain. `docker compose up -d` is all that is needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in credentials
mkdir -p config && cp config.json.example config/config.json
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

On startup the scheduler validates `CRON_TASK` and `ACTUAL_BUDGET_DATA_DIR` and
logs the next three run times, so a mistyped schedule is visible immediately
rather than after a night of nothing happening. Each run is a separate process,
so a failed sync cannot affect the next one, and runs never overlap.

Check the container's health with:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' ghostbudget
docker exec ghostbudget node src/healthcheck.js
```

The health check reports on the scheduler, not on the last sync's outcome: a sync
that fails because Actual Budget or Ghostfolio is unreachable is a problem to
read in the logs, not a reason to restart the container.

### Using Cron

Add this to your crontab to run it automatically:

```bash
# Run every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/ghostbudget && LOG_LEVEL=info /usr/local/bin/npm run sync
```

### Using Systemd

Create a service file (`/etc/systemd/system/ghostbudget-sync.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Sync Actual Budget with Ghostfolio
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/ghostbudget
Environment=LOG_LEVEL=info
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/npm run sync
User=youruser

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create a timer file (`/etc/systemd/system/ghostbudget-sync.timer`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run Ghostbudget sync every hour

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5min
OnUnitActiveSec=1h
Unit=ghostbudget-sync.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Enable and start the timer:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ghostbudget-sync.timer
sudo systemctl start ghostbudget-sync.timer
```


### Balance Conversion

The application automatically handles balance conversion between the two systems:
- Actual Budget stores balances as integers (e.g., 100012 for $1,000.12)
- GhostBudget converts these to decimal format before sending to Ghostfolio (e.g., 1000.12)

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validates required environment variables
- Verifies account mappings exist in both systems
- Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Logs all operations for debugging

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify your Actual Budget and Ghostfolio servers are running
